'glitch' is little program written in ChucK (http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/) whose purpose is to take 2 audio files (NOT necessarily 2 different files) as input and return an audio file that is the combination of the 2. 
One of the 2 audio files must be cosidered as 'main loop', and the other as 'glitch'. Based on the parameters specified in 'settings.txt', the script will then randomly combine the 2 in a way the 'glitch' file interfere with the 'main loop' one.
