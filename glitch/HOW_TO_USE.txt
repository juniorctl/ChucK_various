INTRO
---
  - 'glitch' is ChucK script whose purpose is to take 2 audio files (NOT necessarily 2 different files) as input and return an audio file that is the combination of the 2. 
  
  - One of the 2 audio files must be cosidered as 'main loop', and the other as 'glitch'. Based on the parameters specified in 'settings.txt', the script will then randomly combine the 2 in a way the 'glitch' file interfere with the 'main loop' one.
---

SCRIPT PARAMETERS
---
  - All the parameters must be set in 'settings.txt'

  - Parameters are:
	* mainLoop: main loop audio file name (ie tabla.wav) - audio files need to be in the 'audio' subfolder
	* glitch: glitch loop file name (ie dubSiren.wav) - audio files need to be in the 'audio' subfolder
	* bpm: this SHOULD match the 'mainLoop' bpm
	* interrupter: whether or not 'mainLoop' volume drops when glitches occur
	* pitchmode: 0: no pitch shift; 1: octave pitch (-12,0,+12); 2: chromatic pitch (-12,12)
	* randomness: likelihood that glitches occur
	* loops: outcome (audio file) length in 'bars'
	* reverbMix: reverb mix in a range 0-100

BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT
---
  - Make sure there is at least 1 audio file in the 'audio' subfolder
  - Open 'settings.txt' and set the parameters, then save the file
---

HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT - TERMINAL
---
  - Launch the terminal
  - Go to the script folder
  - Type 'chuck glitch.ck' and press ENTER
  - Check the outcome in the script folder
---

HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT - miniAudicle
---
  - Launch miniAudicle
  - Open the 'glitch.ck' (CTRL+O - or 'File->Open...')
  - Start ChucK Virtual Machine (ALT+. or 'ChucK->Start Virtual Machine')
  - Launch the script (ALT++ - 'ALT' and '+' - or clicking on 'Add Shred')
  - Check the outcome in the script folder
---

OUTCOME
---
  - the audio file generated by 'glitch' is a stereo file that has the same sample rate used by ChucK when running the script
