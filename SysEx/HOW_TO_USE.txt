PREREQUISITES
---
  - Pure Data >= 0.48.1 (http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html)

HOW TO USE
---
  - connect MIDI device to the computer
  - launch SysExOSC.pd patch
  - select MIDI device clicking on 'selecMidiDevice'
  - launch ChucK script with SysExIn and/or SysExOut classes

CHUCK classes
---
  - 'SysExIn' is used to receive SysEx messages
    * this class needs to be initialized using the 'initialize(Event e)' method, that needs an event as argument
    * the event passed to the object must be used to proceed in the 'main' loop (eventName => now)
    * this class receives SysEx as 'strings' (Pure Data turns actual MIDI into strings)

  - 'SysExOut' is used to send SysEx messages
    * this class has only 1 method 'send(int msg[])', that needs an array of integers (SysEx message) as argument
    * must be noted that 'SysExOut' doesn't check whether the SysEx message is malformed (ie doesn't end with '247') or not

EXAMPLES
---
  - launch 'example_send.ck' to send random SysEx messages - it's possible to print messages on Pd
  - launch 'example_recv.ck' to receive SysEx messages - it needs a device that actually sends SysEx
